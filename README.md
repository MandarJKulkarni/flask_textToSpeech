# flask_textToSpeech

Flask application to create an mp3 from a given input text

Use /play/ path to convert the text to audio file and play

e.g. if you are running the server on localhost:5000 then 
        type localhost:5000/play/hello to listen the browser say "hello"
        localhost:5000/play/there to listen the browser say "there"
        
More interesting work is in progress!!
